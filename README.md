## Library Migration

Reusing open-source software libraries has become the norm in modern software development, but libraries can fail due to various reasons, e.g., security vulnerabilities, lacking features, and end of maintenance. In some cases, developers need to replace a library with another competent library with similar functionalities, i.e., library migration. However, it is difficult to make the optimal migration decision with limited information, knowledge, or expertise. Therefore, we conducted large-scale library migration data mining and proposed an evidence-based tool to recommend library migration targets through intelligent analysis upon a large number of GitHub repositories and libraries (Java, JavaScript, and Python).
